        <h2>
            Image label verification
        </h2>
        <p>
            Two options:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Start with bounding box and label displayed from the previous person, either confirm it or make a change
                </li>
                <li>
                    Re-do it without the initial information, if the two have a large enough discrepancy then move on to third person 
                </li>
            </ul>
